    Let me start by saying if anyone ever told a few years ago that I would be in the tech field today, having keen interest in tech related courses, studying cybersecurity, and learning coding, I would have blatantly disagreed. Oh, how I love Cybersecurity!
    Before I resolved to study cybersecurity, it was a lot of hassle. My God! I had moved from one course to another, like ten of them, until Cybersecurity. And so I would always thanks God everyday for the kind of person He made me to be, I mean, I wouldn't have me settle for less.
      I intend to major in Digital Forensics, which is definitely going to involve a lot of coding. And that is why I am here in Fliptotech today. It has been fun ever since I started here, educative too, of course.
    I am in for all the opportunities this course has to offer as I continue in my journey of tech exploration.
